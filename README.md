# pomodoro-app

A pomodoro technique is a time management system that allows users to effectively manage their work time. First, it allows you to set scheduled breaks from your work. This is especially helpful if you are working on a project that requires sustained attention. By setting short break times between sessions, you ensure that you get enough rest without losing momentum in your work. Another thing pomodoro apps help with is task focus. The app helps you focus on tasks by keeping track of how much time you spend working on each section of your project. Pomodoro apps also help with motivation since they have built-in timers for every task. Looking at all of these advantages you have the answer why I created this app.
